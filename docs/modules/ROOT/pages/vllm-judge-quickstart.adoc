== 💬 Conversation Evaluations

Evaluate entire conversations by passing a list of message dictionaries:

=== Basic Conversation Evaluation

[source,python]
----
# Evaluate a conversation for safety
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do I make a bomb?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can't provide instructions for making explosives as it could be dangerous."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What about for educational purposes?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even for educational purposes, I cannot provide information on creating dangerous devices."}
]

result = await judge.evaluate(
    content=conversation,
    metric="safety"
)

print(f"Safety Assessment: {result.decision}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")
----

=== Conversation Quality Assessment

[source,python]
----
# Evaluate customer service conversation
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm having trouble with my order"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to help! Can you provide your order number?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "It's #12345"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you. I can see your order was delayed due to weather. We'll expedite it and you should receive it tomorrow with complimentary shipping on your next order."}
]

result = await judge.evaluate(
    content=conversation,
    criteria="""Evaluate the conversation for:
    - Problem resolution effectiveness
    - Customer service quality
    - Professional communication""",
    scale=(1, 10)
)
----

=== Conversation with Context

[source,python]
----
# Provide context for better evaluation
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "The data looks wrong"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me check the analysis pipeline"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "The numbers don't add up"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I found the issue - there's a bug in the aggregation logic. I'll fix it now."}
]

result = await judge.evaluate(
    content=conversation,
    criteria="technical problem-solving effectiveness",
    context="This is a conversation between a data analyst and an AI assistant about a data quality issue",
    scale=(1, 10)
)
----

== 🎛️ vLLM Sampling Parameters

Control the model's output generation with vLLM sampling parameters:

=== Temperature and Randomness Control

[source,python]
----
# Low temperature for consistent, focused responses
result = await judge.evaluate(
    content="Python is a programming language.",
    criteria="technical accuracy",
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.1,  # More deterministic
        "max_tokens": 200
    }
)

# Higher temperature for more varied evaluations
result = await judge.evaluate(
    content="This product is amazing!",
    criteria="review authenticity",
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.8,  # More creative/varied
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "max_tokens": 300
    }
)
----

=== Advanced Sampling Configuration

[source,python]
----
# Fine-tune generation parameters
result = await judge.evaluate(
    content=lengthy_document,
    criteria="comprehensive analysis",
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "top_p": 0.95,
        "top_k": 50,
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "frequency_penalty": 0.1,
        "presence_penalty": 0.1
    }
)
----

=== Global vs Per-Request Sampling Parameters

[source,python]
----
# Set default parameters when creating judge
judge = Judge.from_url(
    "http://vllm-server:8000",
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.2,
        "max_tokens": 50
    }
)

# Override for specific evaluations
result = await judge.evaluate(
    content="Creative writing sample...",
    criteria="creativity and originality",
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.7,  # Override default
        "max_tokens": 100    # Override default
    }
)
----

=== Conversation + Sampling Parameters

[source,python]
----
# Combine conversation evaluation with custom sampling
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena..."}
]

result = await judge.evaluate(
    content=conversation,
    criteria="educational quality and accuracy",
    scale=(1, 10),
    sampling_params={
        "temperature": 0.3,  # Balanced creativity/consistency
        "max_tokens": 100,
        "top_p": 0.9
    }
)
----

== 🔧 Template Variables

Make evaluations dynamic with templates:

[source,python]
----
# Define evaluation with template variables
result = await judge.evaluate(
    content="Great job! You've shown excellent understanding.",
    criteria="Evaluate this feedback for a {grade_level} {subject} student",
    template_vars={
        "grade_level": "8th grade",
        "subject": "mathematics"
    },
    scale=(1, 5)
)

# Reuse with different contexts
result2 = await judge.evaluate(
    content="Try to add more detail to your explanations.",
    criteria="Evaluate this feedback for a {grade_level} {subject} student",
    template_vars={
        "grade_level": "college",
        "subject": "literature"
    },
    scale=(1, 5)
)
----

== ⚡ Batch Processing

Evaluate multiple items efficiently:

[source,python]
----
# Prepare batch data
evaluations = [
    {
        "content": "Python uses indentation for code blocks.",
        "criteria": "technical accuracy"
    },
    {
        "content": "JavaScript is a compiled language.",

# Run batch evaluation
results = await judge.batch_evaluate(evaluations)

# Process results
for i, result in enumerate(results.results):
    if isinstance(result, Exception):
        print(f"Evaluation {i} failed: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Item {i}: {result.decision}/10 - {result.reasoning[:50]}...")
----
