# Data Drift

Most machine learning models are highly sensitive to the _distribution_ of the data they receive; that is,
how the individual values of various features in inbound data compare to the range of values seen during training.
Often, models will perform poorly on data that looks distributionally different than the data it was
trained on. The analog here is studying for an exam; you'll likely perform well if the exam material matches
what you studied, and you likely won't do particularly well if it doesn't match. A difference between
the training data (the material you studied) and the real-world data received during deployment
(the exam material) is called _data drift_.

For a practical example, imagine a model designed to analyze MRI scans for abnormalities, trained on adult
humans. If this model then receives a scan from, say, an elephant calf, it might be unable to
reconcile this anatomy against its learned intuition and therefore produce meaningless predictions.

However, when models are deployed to production, it can be hard to identify when they fall victim to
data drift, unless you are manually inspecting their inference data. This would require you to a)
have the time and manpower to sift through all the received data and b) understand what would constitute unfamiliar,
"drifted" data to your model, which is of course unfeasible at any sort of large scale.

Instead, we can turn to the _data drift monitoring metrics_ offered by TrustyAI, such as Mean-Shift, FourierMMD, or
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which provide a quantitative measure of the alignment between the training data and the
inference data.

## Context

In this example, we'll be deploying a simple [XGBoost model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), that predicts 
credit card acceptance based on an applicant's age, credit score, years of education, and years in employment.
We'll deploy this model into an Open Data Hub cluster, although this example could also be applied to OpenShift AI as 
well.

Once the model is deployed, we'll use the Mean-Shift metric to monitor the data drift.
Mean-Shift compares a numeric test dataset against a numeric training dataset, and produces a 
[P-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) measuring the probability that the test data came from the same numeric
distribution as the training data.
A p-value of 1.0 indicates a very high likelihood that the test and training data come from the same distribution,
while a p-value < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant drift between the two. 
As a caveat, Mean-Shift performs best when each feature in the data is 
[normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), and other metrics
would be better suited for different or unknown data distributions.

## Setup

Follow the instructions within the [Installation section](Install-on-Open-Data-Hub.md).
Afterwards, you should have an ODH installation, a TrustyAI Operator, and a `model-namespace` project containing
an instance of the TrustyAI Service.

## Deploy Model

2) Navigate to the `model-namespace` created in the setup section: `oc project model-namespace`
2) Deploy the model's storage container: `oc apply -f resources/model_storage_container`
3) Deploy the Seldon MLServer serving runtime: `oc apply -f resources/odh-mlserver-1.x.yaml`
4) Deploy the credit model: `oc apply -f resources/model_guassian_credit.yaml`
6) From the OpenShift Console, navigate to the `model-namespace` project and look at the Workloads -> Pods screen.
    1) You should see at least four pods named `modelmesh-serving-mlserver--1.x-xxxxx`
    2) Once the TrustyAI Service registers the deployed models, you will see the `
       modelmesh-serving-mlserver--1.x-xxxxx` pods get re-deployed.
    3) Verify that the models are registered with TrustyAI by selecting one of the `modelmesh-serving-ovms-1.x-xxxxx` pods. 
       In the Environment tab, if the field `MM_PAYLOAD_PROCESSORS` is set, then your models are successfully registered 
       with TrustyAI: ![Pods in the Model Namespace](drift_model_environment.png)

## Upload Model Training Data To TrustyAI

First, we'll get the route to the TrustyAI service in our project:

```shell
TRUSTY_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/trustyai-service --template={{.spec.host}})
```

Next, we'll send our training data to the `/data/upload` endpoint

```shell
curl -sk $TRUSTY_ROUTE/data/upload  \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @data/training_data.json
```
You should see the message `1000 datapoints successfully added to gaussian-credit-model data`.

### The Data Upload Payload

The data upload payload (an example of which is seen in [data/training_data.json](data/training_data.json)) contains
four main fields:

1) `model_name`: The name of the model to correlate this data with. This should match the name of the model we provided in the [model yaml](resources/model_gaussian_credit.yaml), in this case `gaussian-credit-model`
2) `data_tag`: A string tag to reference this particular set of data. Here, we choose `"TRAINING"`
3) `request`: A [KServe Inference Request](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.8/modelserving/inference_api/#inference-request-json-object), as if you were sending this data directly to the model server's `/infer` endpoint.
4) `response`: (Optionally) the [KServe Inference Response](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.8/modelserving/inference_api/#inference-response-json-objectt) that is returned from sending the above request to the model.

## Examining TrustyAI's Model Metadata

We can verify that TrustyAI has received the data via `/info` endpoint:

1) Query the `/info` endpoint: `curl $TRUSTY_ROUTE/info | jq ".[0].data"`. This will output a json file ([sample provided here](resources/info_response.json)) containing the following information for the model:
    1) The names, data types, and positions of fields in the input and output
    2) The observed values that these fields take (likely `null` in this case, indicating that there are too many unique feature values to merit enumerating)
    3) The total number of input-output pairs observed, in our case, should be `1000`

## Label Data Fields

As you can see, the models does not provide particularly useful field names for our inputs and outputs (all some form of `credit_inputs-x`). We can apply a set of _name mappings_ to these to apply meaningful names to the fields. This is done via POST'ing the `/info/names` endpoint:

```shell
curl -sk  -X POST --location https://trustyai-service-opendatahub-model.apps.trustyai.dzzt.p1.openshiftapps.com/info/names \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"   \
  -d "{
    \"modelId\": \"gaussian-credit-model\",
    \"inputMapping\":
      {
        \"credit_inputs-0\": \"Age\",
        \"credit_inputs-1\": \"Credit Score\",
        \"credit_inputs-2\": \"Years of Education\",
        \"credit_inputs-3\": \"Years of Employment\"
      },
    \"outputMapping\": {
      \"predict-0\": \"Acceptance Probability\"
    }
  }"
```

You should see the message`Feature and output name mapping successfully applied.`

The payload of the request is a simple set of `original-name : new-name` pairs, assigning new meaningful names to the input and output
features of our model.

## Register the Drift Monitoring
To schedule a recurring drift monitoring metric, we'll POST the `/metrics/drift/meanshift/request`

```shell
curl -k -X POST --location $TRUSTY_ROUTE/metrics/drift/meanshift/request -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
        \"modelId\": \"gaussian-credit-model\",
        \"referenceTag\": \"TRAINING\"
      }"
```

The body of the payload is quite simple, requiring a `modelId` to set the model to monitor and a `referenceTag` that
determines which data to use as the reference distribution, in our case `TRAINING` to match the tag we used when we uploaded the training
data. This will then measure the drift of all recorded inference data against
the reference distribution.

## Check the Metrics

1) Navigate to Observe -> Metrics in the OpenShift console. If you're already on that page, you may need to refresh before the new metrics appear in the suggested expressions.
2) Set the time window to 5 minutes (top left) and the refresh interval to 15 seconds (top right)
3) In the "Expression" field, enter `trustyai_meanshift`. It might take a few seconds before the cluster monitoring stacks picks up the new metric, so if `trustyai_meanshift` is not appearing, try refreshing the page.
4) Explore the Metric Chart:
   ![Initial Meanshift Chart](meanshift_initial.png)
5) You'll notice that a metric is emitted for each of the four features and the single output, making for five measurements in total. All metric values should equal 1 (no drift), which makes sense: we _only_ have the training data, which can't drift from itself.

## Collect "Real-World" Inferences
1) Get the route to the model:
```shell
MODEL_ROUTE=https://$(oc get route/gaussian-credit-model --template={{.spec.host}})
```
2) Send data payloads to model:
```shell
for batch in {0..595..5}; do
  curl -k $MODEL_ROUTE/v2/models/gaussian-credit-model/infer -d @data/data_batches/$batch.json
  sleep 1
done
```

## Observe Drift

![Post-deployment metrics](meanshift_post.png).

Navigating back to the Observe -> Metrics page in the OpenShift console, we can see the MeanShift metric
values for the various features changes. Notably, the values for `Credit Score`, `Age`, and `Acceptance Probability` have all dropped to 0, indicating there is a statistically very high likelihood that the values of these fields in the inference data come from a different distribution than that of the training data. Meanwhile, the `Years of Employment` and `Years of Education` scores have dropped to 0.34 and 0.82 respectively, indicating that there is a little drift, but not enough to be particularly concerning. Remember, the Mean-Shift metric scores are p-values, so only values < 0.05 indicate statistical significance.

## A Peek Behind The Curtain

To better understand the what these metrics tell us, let's take a look behind the curtain at the actual data I generated for this example, and look at the real distributions of the training and inference
datasets:

![Real Data Distributions](gaussian_credit_model_distributions.png)

In red are each features' distributions in the training set, while the blue shows the distribution
seen in the "real-world" inference data. We can clearly see that the `Age` and `Credit Score` data
are drawn from two different distributions, while `Years of Education` and `Years of Employment` look
to be the same distribution, and this exactly aligns with the metric values we observed in the previous section. Naturally, the differing input distributions also cause the output `Acceptance Probability` distribution to shift as well.

## Conclusion

The Mean-Shift metric, as well as the more complex FourierMMD and Kolmogorov-Smirnov metrics, are excellent
tools to understand how well your models understand the real-life deployment data that they are receiving.
It is crucially important to monitor data drift, as ensuring that the training and inference data are closely aligned gives your models the best chance at performing well in the real-world. After all,
it does not matter if your models are impeccable over the training data: it is only when they are
deployed to real users that these models provide any meaningful value, and it is only during
this deployment that their performance actually _matters_, where these models might begin to affect your user's lives and livelihoods. Using TrustyAI to monitor the data drift can help you trust that your
models are operating in familiar territory and that they can accurately apply all the intuitions they learned during training.
